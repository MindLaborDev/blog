                        We use Google Analytics to collect information about our
                        website traffic. Google Analytics uses cookies to gather

                        information, and IP addresses. This data helps us
                        understand how our visitors use our website, allowing us
                        to improve our content and user experience.

                        As we rely on Google Analytics for data collection and
                        storage, we recommend reviewing Google's privacy policy
                        to understand their data storage and security practices:

                        their personal information. However, you can opt-out of

                        Our website does not have specific age restrictions.
                        However, given the technical nature of our content, it
                        is unlikely that users under 13 years of age will find
                        it of interest. Parents and guardians are encouraged to
                        monitor their children's online activities.

                        We do not transfer user data internationally. However,
                        as Google Analytics is a global service, your data may
