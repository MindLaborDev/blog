UX Debt:
- "See on Dev.to" button instead of icon
- /about - Make button instead of icon
- Making Projects header sticky when "see more" is clicked

UI Debt:
- Fix potential inconsitent spacings
- main svg background as HTML
- blog = 50% (maybe headings centered)
- No name in blog
- better pfp
- "read article" button height consistency
- likes (maybe like "See on Dev.to")
- fix vue color (generally fix how brand colors are used)
- live demo bg should be black
- fix casing of tags
- blog design cleaning
- spacing on mobile

Content Debt:
- updating live link for tourney (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejMSWVJk8M&ab_channel=Magnesium)
- adding missing projects
- devto comments

Nice to have:
- custom scrollbar
- better emoji font
